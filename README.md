# GPT_Auto_Review
A prototype for how to use the OpenAI API to review a academic paper according to the NeurIPS reviewer guidelines.

To get started you will need to provide an API key and a paper. This can be formatted either as PDF or a tex/txt file.

A small pilot study was run with human participants to rate the helpfulness of generated reviews. The preprint can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05492). Anonymized data from these experiments can also be found in this repository.
